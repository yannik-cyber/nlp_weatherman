We develop a weather chatbot with NLP which can answer your wheather questions.

The chatbot can classify the following intents:
- Weather general
- Temperature
- Rain
- Clouds (includes sun)
- Sun hours (sunrise and sunset)
- Wind
- Greeting
- Bye
- Unknown

With our entity recognition, we can find out the requested location and time for the weather. 

We use the Open Weather OneCall-API for getting the latest weather data (for every requested location).

Our chatbot runs in discord (this enables interactive chats in a discord server).
